Godot C# Game Development, working on Blockris my "Passive Shmup"

Keyboard controlls
	Figure out how to determin what platform game is running on

Hearts for lives at bottom of screen

Visible areas for movement input
	Have fake transparent "buttons" to inidcate where to press to move
	Boost Left, Left, Right, Boost Right

Difficulty System
	More difficulity = more points (so good players don't 
	game the system into being easier, instead they want
	it to be harder)
		Have Difficulty be a number of some kind that
		increases/decreases and * the score additions
	Difficulity should be based on how well they're playing
		Missing Cubes-
		Concentive objects caught+ (streak counter)
		Length of game+ (how long they're allive for)
	Size Based Difficulty Scaling
		Start player large, and decrease size of player
		and objects to increase difficulity/play area
		overtime for a difficulty scaling
	Speed of objects tied to difficluty
	Rate of spawning objectes tied to difficulty
	Types of objects spawned tied to difficulty 
	Boost speed increases with difficulty(???)
	
Have some kind of "max spawn distance" system
	Eneimes can only spawn so far away from the previous one
	To prevent "impossible" spawns from happening (on static enemies)

Inital Player Size
	From rough "feel" testing, 128x128 seems like a
	decent size on PC and Mobile
	
Possible Enemy Types
	Basic Enemy (moves striahgt down, want to hit)
	"Spikey" Enemy (moves straight down, DONT want to hit)
	DVD Screensaver Enemy (bounces from left to right)
	Shooting Enemy (shoots when player under it, but want to hit it)
	Transforming Enemy (becomes another random enemy)
	Status Changing Enemy (want to hit, but does something like reverse controls?)
	Boost giving Enemy/Powerup/Life giving enemy (opional to hit)
	Size increasing Enemy/Powerup
	"Wire" Enemy (creates a wire between it and another that kills you if hit, opional to hit block?)
	"Mirror" Enemy (copies your movement, but if hit's another enemy gets killed)
	Planet and Moon Enemy (spikey enemy in center with a normal enemy rotating around it)
	
Enemy "tutorials"
	First X times (3?) you see a new enemy type
	Get spawner to slow down massively
	Clear the Shuffle Bag
	Spawn enemy in a way in which it's not surrourned by other enemies
	Try to find ways to make it clear what each type does
	
Enemy Designs
	Use clear silhouetting to signal to the player what they want/need to do with each enemy
	Squares = Have to hit
	Triangles = Don't want to hit
	Circles = Optional to hit
	Maybe come up with some more shapes/ideas for silhouette, or merging of shapes
	A square should never be rotated ~45 degrees otherwise it looks like a triangle (pointy)
	
Replays
	Record the RNG Seed at the top of the replay file
	(use UNIX Timestamp as RNG Seed and maybe something else?)
	Record inputs, keep all RNG/Physics deterministic
	For leaderboards, verify replays with a game simulator
	Also record current game version in the replay
	
"Plan Ahead" Gamemode
	Place Player block in a position for X amount of seconds
	See if it avoids enemies/collects blocks
	Freeze after time is up and get player to place in new position
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

Collision
	Players and enimies have area2D
	Player checks for overlaps (so only 1 check
	and enimes can overlap over enimies)
	Player informs enemy that they overlap
	Enemy has logic for handling touching player
	
Boost Bar Display
	Have a centered bar that gets smaller at both ends,
	to shrink towards the centre so eaiser to see when thumbs covering screen
