Size Based Difficulty Scaling
	Start player large, and decrease size of player
	and objects to increase difficulity/play area
	overtime for a difficulty scaling


Inital Player Size
	From rough "feel" testing, 128x128 seems like a
	decent size on PC and Mobile












Collision
	Players and enimies have area2D
	Player checks for overlaps (so only 1 check
	and enimes can overlap over enimies)
	Player informs enemy that they overlap
	Enemy has logic for handling touching player
