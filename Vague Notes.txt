Difficulty System
	More difficulity = more points (so good players don't 
	game the system into being easier, instead they want
	it to be harder)
		Have Difficulty be a number of some kind that
		increases/decreases and * the score additions
	Difficulity should be based on how well they're playing
		Lining up for cubes early+
		Missing Cubes-
		Concentive objects caught+ (streak counter)
		Length of game+ (how long they're allive for)
	Size Based Difficulty Scaling
		Start player large, and decrease size of player
		and objects to increase difficulity/play area
		overtime for a difficulty scaling
	Speed of objects tied to difficluty
	Rate of spawning objectes tied to difficulty
	Types of objects spawned tied to difficulty 


Inital Player Size
	From rough "feel" testing, 128x128 seems like a
	decent size on PC and Mobile
	
Boost Bar Display
	Have a centered bar that gets smaller at both
	ends, to shrink towards the centre
	so eaiser to see when thumbs covering screen
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Replays
	Record the RNG Seed at the top of the replay file
	(use UNIX Timestamp as RNG Seed and maybe something else?)
	Record inputs, keep all RNG/Physics deterministic
	For leaderboards, verify replays with a game simulator
	Also record current game version in the replay

Collision
	Players and enimies have area2D
	Player checks for overlaps (so only 1 check
	and enimes can overlap over enimies)
	Player informs enemy that they overlap
	Enemy has logic for handling touching player
